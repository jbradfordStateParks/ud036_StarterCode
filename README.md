# ud036_StarterCode
Source code for a Movie Trailer website.

## First Things First
You'll need to download and install Python.
Here's a [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/) to the version you'll need. Just grab the one that fits your operating system.

## Now Download These Files
Put them in a folder together. Download `entertainment_center.py`, `fresh_tomatoes.py`, and `media.py`

## Ready, Set, Run
From your Python 2.7 folder in your programs list, open IDLE Python GUI. Go to Open File, navigate to the folder where you saved `entertainment_center.py` and open it. Now just hit F5. That will run the program. 

## Personalize It
While you have `entertainment_center.py` open, you can go grab your favorite movie trailer from YouTube, a poster from WikiMedia to match it, and then just update the movie name and you'll have your own movie on the list.
